psuedocode for algorithm


Part1: Distance Calculation

    -Generate Chirp (multi or single)

    -Enable recording of mirophones

    -Create some kind of buffer for recorded samples

    -extract the "average" chirp recording based on minimized noise    

    -Correlation
    
    -Apply Cancellation 

    -multiply combined signal S_m   

    -take FFT

    -peak selection within reasonable range

    -calculate Object distance based on R. (D = R/2)

    -propmt user for distance calculation


Part2: Amplidute comparison

    -establish baseline parameter for ideal surface (we will need to due some testing with diffrent surfaces)

    -calculate reflection coeff / absorption

    -report to screen
